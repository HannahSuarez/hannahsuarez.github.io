I started getting interested in setting up a mobile penetration testing lab when I first heard about Kali Nethunter.  I went out and bought a decent Android phone just for the purpose of adding Nethunter on early 2015.  It was also a good opportunity to learn more about the ``adb`` (Android Debug Bridge utility) shell and its various limitations.

# Kali Nethunter

Those familiar with Kali will recognize the name - this is the distribution specific to the Android platform.
