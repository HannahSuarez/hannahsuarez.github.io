Next month, on 15 to 19 October 2018, I'll be going to my first RIPE meeting.

The meeting plan is currently being drafted and will be updated on their [site](https://ripe77.ripe.net/programme/meeting-plan/plenary/) however so far the topics include:

* 400G – Don’t Get Confused With This Transceiver Generation

* BGP Scanner

* Withstanding the Infinite: DDoS Defense in the Terabit Era
* BGP Communities: Even More Worms in the Routing Can

* Innovation and Human Rights in the Internet Architecture – Is Self-Regulation Delivering on its Promise?

* EVPN to the Host

There are [archives](https://ripe76.ripe.net/archives/#mon) available where you can see the types of discussions that were talked about in the end.

**What is a RIPE Meeting?**

A RIPE Meeting is a five-day event where Internet Service Providers (ISPs), network operators and other interested parties gather to discuss issues of interest to the Internet community.
