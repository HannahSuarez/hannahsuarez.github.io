Just came home from interesting meetup in Paris, one speaker did a run through
of DefCon & another was all about car/vehicle hacking and even brought in devices and the Car Hacker's Handbook guide for us to go through.

I thought that was excellent to bring the devices over!

They have an idea/project of bringing together a car hacking workshop to make the barrier to tinker more accessible due to material cost/availability.
