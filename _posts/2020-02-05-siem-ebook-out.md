While there is a collection form on the landing page, see the [SIEM campaign](https://pages.nxlog.co/siem-log-collection) to read about log collection best practices for SIEM suites.

I have been working on drafting the eBook also. This publication was drafted by myself for NXLog, design and eBook layout via Marketera.
